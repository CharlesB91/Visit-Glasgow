## Aim

The aim of this website is to target forigen toursits, natives and the general public who may wish to visit the city and take part in the many events Glasgow has to offer. 

## Goals

### Business Goals

- To keep users well informed on what the city has to offer by the eye catching UX design whilst guiding them through an events section, tourist information, social media & contact to the newsletter sign up. 
- To provide a one stop shop for anyone looking to visit glasgow who are curious on the events & tourist attractions and want to get involved

### Client Goals

- Tourists are looking for a site which provides all detailed info on all events & tourism. This will lead them onto to the relevant 3rd party site if they wish to book on the specific activity.

### Wireframing

- Initially sketched my ideas on to my note pad to try and visualise my idea. When I was happy with this I created a simulation using balsamiq for the wireframe. 
- Once decided on the lay out of the home page i decided to keep this consistent through the other 2 pages i had with nav bar at the top, background image, content then finally footer.

## Features

### Home Page

**Navigation Bar**

- Featured on all 4 pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to Home, What's on, Explore and finally social contact section. This is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
- This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
- Additionally the nav bar is on a fixed position so the user does not need to scroll back to the top of the page if they wish to change page. This fixture also collapses into a hamburger icon when the screen width is reduced to mobile screen size.
- The particular bold colour which been chosen which compliments the famous people make Glasgow image below the navigation bar.

**Explore-Tourist-Info**

- This section has been created to inform the user of the various bus tours, museums and historic Glasgow university tours available.
- This is focused more on the conventional tourist who is keen to explore the historical aspects of the city which applies to a different audience so felt this should be on a separate page.
- Each section ie bus tour, Kelvingrove art museum, Glasgow University has an accompanying image with some brief back-ground text to inform the user of what to expect. The headings also contain links if the user wishes to book tickets.

- This section allows the user to sign up to the weekly news letter offered. The fields required are first name, surname, email address with an accompanying submit button.
- This features a basic sign up form highlighted in the same colour as the footer. This sign up form is not fully functional as backend technologies will be required which are outside the scope of this project.

## Features Left to Implement

- Additional future features which will improve the sites capability would be to add an interactive map of the full city highlighting historical buildings, museums, popular venues.
- Additionally adding a section with food/drink venues within a carousel would enhance the site also.
- Lastly backend technology’s would make the newsletter sign up page fully functional.

### User Experience Testing

- Asked family members to review my website on various devices on how they found the site. This included how well they navigated if they understood the general idea and concepts. Did receive positive feedback however it was pointed out that the links I had on the images would be better suited to the headings under the images. Have now made those changes.

### Browser Testing

- This site has been testing through various popular browsers for compatibility. These include, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.

## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

- Did encounter some bugs whilst building the site in particular the explore page when laying out images on either side of page when viewed on larger screens. Flex box would not allow me to display each image on either side easily with the text underneath of the image ie Glasgow bus tours. After some research via w3 schools it was clear that I had to wrap the image and heading in a separate div from the paragraphs. This then allowed me to position the images the way I wanted.
- Nav bar did have some bugs when screen size was reduced - all nav items could not be seen. This was resolved by reducing the font size via media query.

### Un-resolved Bugs

- No un-resolved bugs.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
